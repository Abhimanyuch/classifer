# Spam classification
# About
we try to classify Email as spam and ham using Logistic-regression which is a Machine learning algorithm.The notebook (code.py.ipynb) consists steps to process and explore the dataset.converts emails to vectors and applying ML techniques for the same.
# Install 
This project requires "python3" and the following python libraries installed:
Numpy,
Pandas,
Sci-kit learn,
Nltk,
Matplotlib,
Os,
email,
Seaborn,
bs4 or Beautifulsoup,
string.

Make sure you have have Jupyter-Notebook installed.
You could just install Anaconda distribution of Python,which already has the above packages and more included.

# Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:
"jupyter notebook code.py.ipynb"

# Dataset
The Dataset is a set of emails collected for email Spam research. It contains one set of emails in English according being ham (legitimate) or spam.
dataset is here [link](https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/)

# Execution instructions
During execution first we have to download dataset. Dataset will be downloaded in zip file, we have to extract files.5 folders will be created put all 5 folders inside a parent folder named Data. After extraction when we'll run the code. There is a "variable" named "dir_1" we'll have to provide path in it.It will be different in different systetm in my case or according to my system which was  ""C:\\Users\\HP\\Desktop\\Data\\"" .This is the most important step as it will help in reading files or importing files in variables.
